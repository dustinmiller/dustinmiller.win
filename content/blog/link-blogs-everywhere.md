I saw [an article on Hacker News where someone built a link blog like Simon Willison's](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42933383).

Having wanted to do the same myself, I figured now is the time and I'll use this as the first article

So thanks to [Xuanwo's post](https://xuanwo.io/links/2025/01/link-blog/) and [Simon](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/4/build-a-link-blog/) for the inspiration

Deepseek and ChatGPT helped with the CSS and some of the templating too ;)
